    "This function first initalizes an empty list and a varible x = 0. Then it loops through the first array from the beginning to end to find if the item at the position i is a negative number. If it is not a negative number, we will add that to the list. If we have a negative number, we want to assign that to x. To do the next step, the negative number must be an absolute value. If the abs value of x is greater than the stack, it will return false, this is for an array with a list of only a negative number. Now if that is not the case we want to move on to the next step which is a while loop. Here is how we remove the numbers by the negative number value. While x is negative pop the stack also whenever you pop from the stack, add to x. This ensures that once x is positive, it will break the while loop. Lastly, compare the two lists, if theyre the same return true, if they arent, return false. "

In which the function will check if the ;ast item is less than the target, if so it wil return the lenght of arr. We do this to show where the target would go if there was an array with one one elment smaller than the target. Now we loop through the array from the beginning to the end (ie left to right). we do this to find if the item at each position is the target. If the item at the idex i is the target we return the target. If it is less than, we add the position to the left of the index, if it is larger we add it to the right of the index. We do so by asssigning left as i - 1 (ie in front) and right as i +1 (ie behind). Lastly, if the target is not in the list and the list consist of an item that is greater than the target, we return left which is currently at position 0. "

    "the function works by first initalizing left and right; left being 0 (ie where it begins) and right being len(arr) - 1 (ie where it ends). So then it asks if the target is in the arr. If it is not in the array then we run a while loop. While left is equal to or less than right, then find the mid-point. Midpoint is left plus right // <-(to enure int). Now if the mid point is less than target add 1 to mid and return left. We add one to mid because that would mean making it the index right after the value at the index[mid]. This is because we want it to be ascending order. Now if mid was larger than left it would trigger the else statement. That statement will then assign to right the mid minus 1. We do this for similar reasons above but this time we are assigning it in front of the mid point because it is larger than the target. So we want the target to be in front to keep ascending order. In this case right becomes -1 and we print left which still has the value at position 0. \n",

If it is greater than have right assigned i - 1 (to keep it ascending) if it is less than then have left assigned i + 1 to keep it ascending.
